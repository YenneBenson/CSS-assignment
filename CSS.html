            <p id="first-section">Hi! I am <strong>Inyeneobong Benson,</strong> currently learning Front-End web development with Stutern, under a scholarship by the 1000 women in Software Engineering.
                Technology, to me, is simply the practical application of scientific knowledge to everyday life. As the world continues to advance in technology,
                it only increases and emphazises the need and importance of technology use on a regular basis.
                I fell in love with technology because it makes a lot of things way easier, and I particulary love the 
                way websites work.

            <p id="second-section">It's been a while in this program, and I must say the journey has been amazing. I've learnt so much from 
                the mentors and tutors. From building basic structures of a website with HTML, to making the design look appealing to the eye with CSS.
                The <i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</i> is used to give a web page a more appealing look, and to put in place 
                different user experience concepts.

            <!-- <h2>Third Section</h2> -->
            <p id="third-section">In the CSS box model, there are different concepts, some of which are padding, margin and borders.
                <strong>Padding</strong> is the space around an element, inside a defined border. <strong>Margin</strong> is the space around the border and element.
                <strong>Border</strong> covers the element and the padding.
